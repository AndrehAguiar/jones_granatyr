Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.',\n",
       " 'According to its President, it is in a position to do so. Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed.',\n",
       " \"Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting. In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.\",\n",
       " 'My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and which you have mentioned, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday, including its proposed administrative reform, because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.',\n",

       " 'After all, we do not wish to quarrel with the Commission; if at all possible, we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to tread the same path.',\n",

       " 'You cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content.',\n",
       " \"That is why we would recommend - and it is my impression that the Commission is also open to this idea - that we hold the debate on the Commission's long-term programme up to the year 2005 in February - and I hope that the Commission will agree on a programme before then which it will propose to us - and that, at the same time, in February we also hold the debate on the Commission's legislative programme for the year 2000.\",\n",
       " 'The fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together.',\n",

       " 'We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.',\n",
       " \"But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Barón Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.\",\n",
       " \"Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission' s legislative programme.\",\n",
       " 'I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.',\n",

I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.',\n",
       " 'I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.',\n",

       " 'We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups. As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.',\n",
       " 'It is not a lot to ask.',\n",
       " 'I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.',\n",

       " 'The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).',\n",
       " \"Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.\",\n",
       " 'Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.',\n",
       " 'Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.',\n",
       " \"Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.\",\n",
       " 'All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.',\n",
       " 'Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.',\n",
       " 'They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.',\n",
       " 'The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.',\n",
       " 'By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.',\n",
       " 'I would urge you to endorse this.',\n",
       " 'Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.',\n",
       " 'As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.',\n",
       " 'The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.',\n",
       " 'The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.',\n",
       " 'In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.',\n",
       " 'Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.',\n",
       " 'All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.',\n",
       " 'We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.',\n",
       " 'Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.',\n",
       " 'I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.',\n",
       " 'In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.',\n",
       " 'Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.',\n",
       " 'The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.',\n",
       " 'I congratulate him on his excellent report.',\n",
       " 'Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.',\n",
       " \"The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.\",\n",
       " 'My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.',\n",
       " 'When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.',\n",
       " 'We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.',\n",
       " 'Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.',\n",
       " 'I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.',\n",
       " 'We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements. This is a pity, in a sense.',\n",
       " 'Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.',\n",
       " 'This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.',\n",
       " 'Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead. Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.',\n",
       " 'In short, the issue is an important one.',\n",
       " 'If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.',\n",
       " 'There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.',\n",
       " 'These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.',\n",
       " 'It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.',\n",
       " 'The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.',\n",
       " 'I would like to mention one final point.',\n",
       " \"With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.\",\n",
       " 'This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.',\n",
       " 'This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.',\n",
       " 'Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.',\n",
       " 'The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.',\n",
       " 'Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.',\n",
       " 'The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.',\n",
       " 'I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.',\n",
       " 'This, however, does not seem feasible.',\n",
       " 'Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.',\n",
       " 'I should like to make just a few comments.',\n",
       " 'Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.',\n",
       " 'Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.',\n",
       " 'This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.',\n",
       " 'My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.',\n",
       " 'In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.',\n",
       " 'However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.',\n",
       " 'I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.',\n",
       " 'Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.',\n",
       " 'My third point has also been mentioned already.',\n",
       " 'As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.',\n",
       " 'We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.',\n",
       " 'But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.',\n",
       " 'We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.',\n",
       " 'The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.',\n",
       " \"Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.\",\n",
       " 'As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.',\n",
       " 'The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.',\n",
       " 'In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.',\n",
       " 'In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.',\n",
       " 'Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.',\n",
       " 'Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.',\n",
       " 'This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.',\n",
       " 'But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.',\n",
       " 'As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.',\n",
       " 'I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.',\n",

       " 'Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation.',\n",
       " \"Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.\",\n",
       " 'In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.',\n",

       " 'Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.',\n",
       " \"The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.\",\n",
       " 'It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.',\n",
       " 'The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.',\n",
       " 'The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.',\n",
       " 'The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.',\n",
       " 'The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.',\n",
       " 'Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.',\n",

       " 'It is good that this directive should be established now, as, otherwise, Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.',\n",
       " \"The Commission' s proposal, however, does not take account of all the facts, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.\",\n",
       " \"Consequently, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch' s intrinsically excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee. My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.\",\n",

       " 'I thought that it was quite superb.',\n",
       " \"On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.\",\n",
       " 'This directive is a contribution to this.',\n",
       " 'What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.',\n",

       " 'That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, the report we are discussing here does not, in itself, entail any major changes.',\n",
       " 'Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.',\n",

       " 'I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance, namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament, Mr Ari Vatanen.',\n",
       " 'In many ways, the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another.',\n",
       " 'By approving this amendment, we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union.',\n",

For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them.',\n",
       " 'Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.',\n",
       " 'If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at?',\n",

       " 'Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.',\n",
       " 'The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.',\n",
       " \"In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission' s attention to this issue.\",\n",
       " 'Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague, Mrs Flautre, who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill.',\n",
       " \"I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.\",\n",
       " 'These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.',\n",
       " 'In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.',\n",
       " \"These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.\",\n",
       " 'We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.',\n",
       " 'In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.',\n",
       " 'The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund. But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.',\n",
       " \"It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States' annual national plans for employment.\",\n",
       " 'We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission, in accordance with its mandate, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.',\n",
       " \"I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.\",\n",
       " 'This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.',\n",
       " 'The consequences do not inspire hope.',\n",
       " 'It is the young people who are disappearing, who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.',\n",
       " 'This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.',\n",
       " 'We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union. Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.',\n",
       " 'For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc.',\n",
       " 'However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, to be competitive and multi-functional, both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.',\n",
       " 'It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues, which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.',\n",
       " 'In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.',\n",

       " 'I think that this work has been carried out extremely well.',\n",
       " 'I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.',\n",
       " 'We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.',\n",
       " 'The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament, particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.',\n",
       " 'In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.',\n",
       " 'In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative.',\n",
       " 'Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds.',\n",
       " 'If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.',\n",
       " 'Also, in order to attain our objectives, to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment, it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies, to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.',\n",
       " 'All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.',\n",

       " 'These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us.',\n",
       " 'Finally, in this time of natural disasters, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds.',\n",
       " 'As you know, it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation.',\n",
       " 'Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want.',\n",
       " 'Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response, even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.',\n",
       " 'I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.',\n",
       " 'I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.',\n",
       " 'As far as French planning experts are concerned, for example, the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country.',\n",
       " 'Well, the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process.',\n",
       " 'Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator.',\n",
       " 'Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds.',\n",
       " 'What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level.',\n",
       " 'The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.',\n",
       " 'The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere. It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.',\n",
       " 'This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.',\n",

       " 'To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds.',\n",
       " 'For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.',\n",
       " 'For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.',\n",
       " \"There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention.\",\n",
       " 'Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided. Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds.',\n",
       " 'This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.',\n",
       " \"I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern.\",\n",
       " 'Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.',\n",
       " 'But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.',\n",
       " 'The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.',\n",
       " 'That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.',\n",
       " 'I would like to explain our thinking here.',\n",
       " 'Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.',\n",
       " 'Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as \"value for money\" indicators in the grant-giving process.',\n",
       " 'Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period. But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.',\n",
       " 'Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.',\n",
       " 'Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.',\n",
       " 'There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.',\n",
       " 'Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see.',\n",
       " 'That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.',\n",
       " 'If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a \"hand-up\".',\n",
       " 'I urge the House to support these changes.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.',\n",
       " \"The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions. Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.\",\n",
       " 'These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.',\n",
       " 'Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life.',\n",
       " 'Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland.',\n",
       " 'In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best.',\n",
       " \"Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.\",\n",
       " \"However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy.\",\n",
       " 'Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it.',\n",
       " 'The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South.',\n",
       " 'Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.',\n",
       " 'If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.',\n",
       " 'Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.',\n",
       " \"The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.\",\n",
       " \"A large section of the Union' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots.\",\n",
       " 'Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.',\n",
       " 'The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.',\n",
       " 'We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.',\n",
       " \"We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives.\",\n",
       " 'Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.',\n",
       " 'In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira.',\n",
       " \"I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament?\",\n",
       " 'Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.',\n",
       " \"However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.\",\n",
       " 'Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.',\n",
       " 'I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.',\n",
       " 'I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.',\n",
       " 'I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.',\n",
       " \"Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe' s most highly-developed regions.\",\n",
       " 'They are growing, but only in terms of GDP.',\n",
       " 'They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.',\n",
       " \"Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens' greatest problem.\",\n",
       " 'Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.',\n",
       " 'It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.',\n",
       " 'Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.',\n",
       " \"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments, occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter' s report.\",\n",
       " 'Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.',\n",
       " 'Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.',\n",
       " 'So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made.',\n",
       " 'Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds.',\n",
       " \"This means putting forward the Commission' s priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.\",\n",
       " 'The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use, to the optimum and efficient use, as some of you have wished, of Community involvement, including, Mr Bradbourn, using, if necessary, the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies.',\n",
       " 'When I speak of optimum utilisation, I am referring both to the national and regional levels.',\n",
       " 'And so, Mr Seppänen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund.',\n",
       " 'This is the purpose of these guidelines.',\n",
       " 'Regarding their content, as you know, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but, at the same time, very passionately, as I understood her presentation just now.',\n",
       " 'The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create, in all sectors, but especially in the private sector, as Mr Berend said, the maximum number of serious, worthwhile and permanent jobs, the competitiveness of regional economies, all regional economies, and in particular, Mr Evans, that of Wales, but not only of Wales.',\n",
       " 'And, because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission, let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre, be they remote regions, island regions or, of course, the most remote regions which are, naturally, the most distant.',\n",
       " 'Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who asked me about this, that, as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions, the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.',\n",
       " 'Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation.',\n",
       " 'We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.',\n",
       " 'I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and, within the College, we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions. I would thank you for your understanding in this matter.',\n",
       " 'So that is the first priority, the competitiveness of regional economies.',\n",
       " 'The second priority, which several of you have stressed, Mr Puerta in particular, but there were others, not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority, is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment, particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.',\n",
       " 'Ladies and gentlemen, we now have a European Union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great, proving the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund, but where, at the same time, in relation to unemployment - as you wrote, Mrs Schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions. This is a situation which is, as it should be, unjustifiable and intolerable.',\n",
       " 'As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention, as far as possible, with your support, of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social, human and territorial cohesion, particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe, a Europe of wealthy districts but, at the same time, a Europe of impoverished areas.',\n",
       " 'The third objective is urban and rural development, within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.',\n",
       " 'In fact, the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account. The first is rural development, and let me say, Mrs Schroedter, that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport, an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time.',\n",
       " 'I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country. The second principle is that of equal opportunities, particularly for men and women, as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union.',\n",
       " 'Finally, and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House, particularly yourself, Mrs Schroedter, in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies, for development or redevelopment, which, of all the priorities, offer the maximum opportunity to synergy, to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership. You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership, yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines.',\n",
       " 'However, I do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that, as far as I am concerned, this partnership - and I spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool, one used to involve local brainpower, be it in the public sector, in the form of elected representatives, the social and educational sectors, associations, or in the private sector; a decentralised partnership, and let me mention in this connection, in response to Mrs Angelilli, the territorial pacts, which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.',\n",
       " 'These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions.',\n",
       " 'I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, and firstly on procedure.',\n",
       " 'It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date.',\n",
       " 'Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in February 1999, in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text, my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, presented them to Parliament immediately.',\n",
       " 'Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999.',\n",
       " 'Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.',\n",
       " 'And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.',\n",
       " 'Now to the form. On the subject of the role of the guidelines, Mrs Schroedter, you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives, often very precise ones, should be provided.',\n",
       " 'I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc.',\n",
       " 'The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document.',\n",
       " 'Drawing to a close, I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated, Mrs Schroedter.',\n",
       " 'I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.',\n",
       " \"This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring' s negotiations.\",\n",
       " 'The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations, which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad, indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies.',\n",
       " 'I actually quoted the text itself, in quotation marks.',\n",
       " 'Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.',\n",
       " 'You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.',\n",
       " 'I find the opposite the case.',\n",
       " 'I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches, and shall attach, to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.',\n",
       " 'Indeed, I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere.',\n",
       " \"As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up, particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez, the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe' s rural heritage.\",\n",
       " 'It must, however, be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds, whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.',\n",
       " 'And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.',\n",
       " 'At this stage, I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions.',\n",
       " 'In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.',\n",
       " 'Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France.',\n",
       " 'I shall therefore reserve the right, if you permit, sir, to give you my own opinion, which, to a great extent, matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2.',\n",
       " 'I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow.',\n",
       " 'We shall then have an appropriate tool for working, particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms.',\n",
       " 'Indeed, this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.',\n",
       " 'In conclusion, with thanks for your understanding, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the quality of your work and that of the committee, and to tell you that I am very pleased, apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines. We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view.',\n",
       " 'I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines, which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes.',\n",
       " 'This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.',\n",
       " 'The debate is closed.',\n",
       " 'The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.',\n",
       " 'Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union',\n",
       " 'The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].',\n",
       " 'Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.',\n",
       " 'I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.',\n",
       " 'The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.',\n",
       " 'In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.',\n",
       " 'Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.',\n",
       " \"Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.\",\n",
       " 'Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.',\n",
       " \"It must be remembered that, currently, the European Union' s overall competitiveness is, in general terms, 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units, that is the regions, also improves. Furthermore, this is at a time when technological development, economic globalisation and our problems, which are enlargement and the single currency, demand that the regions, as well as businesses and individuals, make more of an effort to be competitive.\",\n",
       " \"The European Commission' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.\",\n",
       " 'I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative.',\n",
       " 'The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities.',\n",
       " \"The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.\",\n",
       " 'It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.',\n",
       " 'This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.',\n",
       " 'Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.',\n",
       " \"The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aims.\",\n",
       " 'The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.',\n",
       " 'Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.',\n",
       " 'The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.',\n",
       " 'We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.',\n",
       " 'Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions?',\n",
       " 'How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development?',\n",
       " \"It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas.\",\n",
       " 'The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.',\n",
       " 'Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.',\n",
       " 'This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.',\n",
       " 'In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.',\n",
       " 'For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.',\n",
       " 'In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.',\n",
       " 'It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how.',\n",
       " 'Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.',\n",
       " \"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes.\",\n",
       " 'We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%.',\n",
       " 'Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007.',\n",
       " \"There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.\",\n",
       " \"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.\",\n",
       " 'The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation, boosting equality of opportunity, increasing the sustainability of employment and development, are only mentioned in passing.',\n",
       " 'This attitude appears to me to be unjustified. I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.',\n",
       " 'This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region, that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises.',\n",
       " 'It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions, that is to say job creation measures, special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.',\n",
       " 'They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities.',\n",
       " 'Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions.',\n",
       " 'After all, the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.',\n",
       " 'Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer.',\n",
       " 'And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and, to a lesser extent, in rationalisation.',\n",
       " 'It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.',\n",
       " 'The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.',\n",
       " 'In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.',\n",
       " 'For example, these would be measures for vocational training, for further education, for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process, for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements, in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report.',\n",

       " 'Thirdly, the need to develop the employment side of growth, even though I am aware, as Mr van Dam just said, that the prime responsibility is that of the Member States, and that, when we speak of the responsibility of Member States, and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy, we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.',\n",
       " 'Mr Fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.',\n",

       " 'Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.',\n",

       " 'Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio Sánchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.',\n",
       " 'On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.',\n",
       " 'This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler.',\n",
       " 'Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.',\n",
       " 'Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.',\n",
       " 'I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.',\n",
       " 'In any event, I have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report: the definition, compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned, particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This will constitute a great challenge to us all, for you and for the Commission, in the next few years.',\n",

       " 'Finally, I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are, in any case, familiar with, but whose main elements I should like to reiterate.',\n",
       " 'Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.',\n",
       " 'This is my first point regarding the policy.',\n",
       " 'My second point regarding the policy is as follows: the Structural Funds have made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the convergence process.',\n",
       " 'All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that, over the last decade, more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds.',\n",
       " 'I have, however, taken note, particularly with regard to the most remote regions, Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau, and Mr Nogueira Román too, that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take-up aspects, the fight against social exclusion, which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions, and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.',\n",
       " 'Now to my fourth point regarding the policy; enlargement of the Union, the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions, the major challenge, too, for the European policy on cohesion, a point which Mr van Dam highlighted.',\n",
       " 'I shall say that something is already taking shape in Berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.',\n",

       " \"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.\",\n",
       " 'The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued.',\n",
       " 'Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid, on average, for the period under review, is in the order of EUR 95 billion, corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995, a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.',\n",
       " 'To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.',\n",
       " 'This being the case, there are considerable disparities between states, which may be measured in various ways, such as, for example, as a percentage of added value and per wage earner.',\n",
       " 'I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid, which may be assimilated in some way into state aid.',\n",
       " 'This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund, among other things, which come at the top of the list.',\n",
       " 'This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report.',\n",
       " \"We note, first of all, that the committee considers the data, as presented in the Commission' s annual report, to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate, sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition, pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty.\",\n",
       " 'The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.',\n",
       " 'It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.',\n",
       " 'It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example, has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid, accessible via the Internet.',\n",
       " 'Having better, more detailed information available, particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.',\n",
       " 'And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.',\n",
       " 'By stressing, primarily, the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee, and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you, avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was, in absolute terms, either too high or not high enough.',\n",
       " 'Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.',\n",
       " \"This being the case, various amendments to the rapporteur' s initial draft report were adopted in committee, particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results.\",\n",
       " 'Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.',\n",
       " 'Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, in view of the inadequacies, acknowledged or not, of private investment alone, the market failures or inadequacies of the market.',\n",
       " 'There is in particular one amendment, let me point out, concerning the energy sector, which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I see as particularly important.',\n",
       " 'I should like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by stressing two things: firstly, a concern of the members of the committee and, secondly, a demand of our committee.',\n",
       " 'The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in terms of competition policy and state aid.',\n",
       " 'This is undoubtedly a complex issue, and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter, particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need, in all probability, to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.',\n",
       " 'And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.',\n",
       " 'As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.',\n",
       " \"Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission.\",\n",
       " 'There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.',\n",
       " 'The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.',\n",
       " 'Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future.',\n",
       " \"The European Commission' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty.\",\n",
       " \"The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament.\",\n",
       " 'As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry.',\n",
       " 'According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.',\n",
       " 'Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid.',\n",
       " 'In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.',\n",
       " 'The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.',\n",
       " 'These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether.',\n",
       " 'In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.',\n",
       " 'However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.',\n",
       " 'As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.',\n",
       " 'There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code. No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.',\n",
       " 'This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.',\n",
       " \"Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.\",\n",
       " 'We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind.',\n",
       " \"The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision.\",\n",
       " 'We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.',\n",
       " 'This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.',\n",
       " 'A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.',\n",
       " 'What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets.',\n",
       " \"We also need to criticise the Commission' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.\",\n",
       " 'The Commission will be called upon, in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999, to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions, thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.',\n",
       " 'Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity, which we have ourselves created, in plenary sitting.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is not complete.',\n",
       " 'Subsidies, monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike.',\n",
       " 'National governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time, but then it happens again.',\n",
       " 'Subsidies distort allocations, both within and between countries.',\n",
       " 'A successive phasing out of State aid is required, and more and more markets must be opened up to competition.',\n",
       " 'This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies, both private and public.',\n",
       " 'Public monopolies are, more often than not, phased out reluctantly.',\n",
       " 'Increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare, including within the spheres of education, health care and social services.',\n",
       " 'Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures.',\n",
       " 'Europe must be modernised, made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies.',\n",
       " 'Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living.',\n",
       " 'It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently.',\n",
       " 'In fact, competition policy and consumer policy belong together.',\n",
       " 'The internal market is the basis for our work.',\n",
       " 'Its legislation is to apply equally to all, to large and small countries alike.',\n",
       " 'A systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled.',\n",
       " \"The EU' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed.\",\n",
       " 'The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy.',\n",
       " \"In order to be effective, it must be well anchored in the Member States' national authorities.\",\n",
       " \"In six months' time, it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation' s effects upon the Commission' s role.\",\n",
       " 'The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests.',\n",
       " 'This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed.',\n",
       " 'There will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate.',\n",
       " 'The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition.',\n",
       " 'Wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership, which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for.',\n",
       " 'We have a quite exciting debate in front of us.',\n",
       " 'A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings, at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points.',\n",
       " 'Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens.',\n",
       " 'In fact, in my own constituency of Stockholm, we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies.',\n",
       " 'We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay.',\n",
       " 'We hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today, even though there has been a delay.',\n",
       " 'I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation.',\n",
       " 'Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.',\n",
       " 'All this is to the good of the consumer.',\n",
       " 'But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.',\n",
       " 'The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.',\n",
       " 'Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate.',\n",
       " 'At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world, of course.',\n",
       " 'It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.',\n",
       " 'However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape.',\n",
       " 'The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.',\n",
       " 'If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts.',\n",
       " 'We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.',\n",
       " 'It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.',\n",
       " 'The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear, something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion.',\n",
       " 'But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy.',\n",
       " 'Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted, then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined.',\n",
       " 'However, when it comes to what the future holds for competition, there are two issues dear to my heart.',\n",
       " 'One is subsidiarity.',\n",
       " 'We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.',\n",
       " 'Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union.',\n",
       " 'I would cite, by way of example, the issue of job creation schemes, savings banks and regional banks, and Gütesiegel.',\n",
       " 'Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products.',\n",
       " 'This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.',\n",
       " 'I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation.',\n",
       " 'We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other.',\n",
       " 'My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now.',\n",
       " 'I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector, but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters.',\n",
       " \"These days, someone who lives in an old people' s home is accommodated within the social field.\",\n",
       " 'However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition.',\n",
       " 'Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.',\n",
       " 'To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.',\n",
       " 'Thank you very much, Mr Radwan.',\n",
       " 'I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak, inappropriately in your case, as a maiden speech.',\n",
       " 'Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member, Robert Goebbels, who is unable to attend due to a political commitment.',\n",

       " 'A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures.',\n",
       " 'Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market, it would not make any difference to the real world.',\n",
       " 'Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.',\n",
       " 'While, since the dawn of time, the market has been the key forum for human interchange, it has never been perfect.',\n",
       " 'The market favours the short term and immediate profits.',\n",
       " 'On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties, consumers and workers.',\n",

       " 'Finally, aid can enable restructuring, offer training, save jobs and thus know-how.',\n",
       " \"The main objective of the Union' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.\",\n",
       " 'This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union, particularly economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.',\n",
